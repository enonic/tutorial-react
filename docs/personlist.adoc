= PersonList Component
:sourcedir: ../
:imagesdir: media/

When the PersonList component is first rendered, it has no `data`, so it simply returns `null`.

It has a useEffect hook that will asyncronously run a fetch using the imported PERSON_LIST_QUERY.

Once the fetch returns, it will update the `data` state, so there is something to render.

Since the state has changed it will now be re-rendered based on the new state.

This time it will return an unordered list with one list-item per person in the data.

The list-item consists of a single Link component which contains an image and the displayName of the person.

Notice that the Link component is imported from `react-router-dom` and that it's `to` prop follows the pattern described in the routing chapter.

Since the personList.sass file is imported, the styling becomes available in the App.css which is already loaded.

The final result in the browser is a page with a grid of 9 images (3 rows with 3 images on each row).

The displayName is initally hidden, but becomes visible when the link is hovered.

In addition, images are grayscaled but become colorful when hovered.

== Query

First, let's define a query that we want to execute to fetch the data:

.src/queries/personList.gql
[source,graphql]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/queries/personList.gql[]
----

To be able to import the `.gql` files we need to add a declaration file for them in the same directory:

.src/queries/index.d.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/queries/index.d.ts[]
----

== Component

To define a component create a `PersonList.tsx` file in the `components` directory:

.src/components/PersonList.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/components/PersonList.tsx[]
----

NOTE: Notice the `import PERSON_LIST_QUERY from '!!raw-loader!../queries/personList.gql';` line.
This syntax instructs webpack to load the file as a raw string.

As you can see this component has 1 parameter `guillotineUrl` which is an url where we want to fetch data from.

We defined common constants in a separate file:

.src/components/constants.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/components/constants.ts[]
----

== Styles

To style the PersonList component we also need a complementary sass file:

.src/styles/personList.sass
[source,Sass]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/styles/personList.sass[]
----

== Update App.tsx

Finally, we need to update the App.tsx file to include the `PersonList` component and display it on the root path `/`:

.src/App.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import './App.sass';

import {Route, BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, } from 'react-router-dom';

import {PersonList} from './components/PersonList';

export default function App({guillotineUrl = '/site/intro/master'}: { guillotineUrl?: string }) {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<PersonList guillotineUrl={guillotineUrl}/>}/>
        <Route
          element={<h1>Person url</h1>}
          path="/p/:name/:personId"
        />
        <Route path='*' element={<p>URL doesn't exist!</p>}/>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
----

NOTE: We added optional `guillotineUrl` parameter that is passed to the `PersonList` component.
This lets us define the url where we want to fetch data from.
By default, it's set to `/site/intro/master` which will be appended to the `proxy` setting from the <<setup-react#, Setup React>> chapter.

== Result

Now, if you did everything correctly, you should see a grid of 9 images.
When you hover over the image, the displayName will appear and the image will become colorful.

image::./person-list.png[width=1200]

== Next step

Let's create a <<person#,Person>> component now.
