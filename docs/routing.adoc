= Routing
:sourcedir: ../

The client-side web application is a `one-page application` using React.

There is [red]#no server-side routing#. All url's under the webapp baseUrl simply returns the same `one-page application`.

There is however [green]#client-side routing#, so that the `one-page application` will render different components depening upon the url.

In this tutorial we are using the `react-router-dom` npm module.

The routing in the code below is setup in such a way that visiting:

`/` will render the PersonList component

`/p/lea-seydoux/a8b374a2-c532-45eb-9aa1-73d1c37cd681` will render the Person component providing a params prop with `name`: 'lea-seydoux' and `personId`: 'a8b374a2-c532-45eb-9aa1-73d1c37cd681'

`/non-macthing-path` will render a fallback paragraph with the message: URL doesn't exist!
