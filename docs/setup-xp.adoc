= Set up Enonic XP
:sourcedir: ../

The easiest way to boot up an Enonic XP instance is to use the Enonic CLI.
If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command:

[source, Terminal]
----
npm install -g @enonic/cli
----

TIP: More installation methods along with CLI documentation can be found https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/stable/install[here]

== Install Enonic XP

Now that you have the CLI installed, you can create a new sandbox with Enonic XP instance by running the following command:

[source,Terminal]
----
enonic sandbox create react_box -t intro -f
----

This will create a sandbox named `react_box` using latest Enonic XP distribution and start it after creation.

NOTE: The `-t intro` flag tells the CLI to use the `intro` template which conveniently has graphQL app installed along with some data to query.
