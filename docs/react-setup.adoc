In this chapter you will create a React application with TypeScript support.

== Create React app

Start by running the following command:

[source,Terminal]
----
npx create-react-app react-enonic --template typescript
----

This will create a React app and place it in a folder called `react-enonic/`.

TIP: You can read more about the `create-react-app` tool on https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started[their website^]


== Install dependencies

Next, add some handy npm modules to the project:

[source,Terminal]
----
cd react-demo

npm install --save react-router-dom sass @enonic/react-components @enonic/js-utils
----

== Configure

The React applications also needs to know the location of the Enonic API, as you we'll need it for fetching data later.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following line:

..env
[source,properties]
----
ENONIC_API=
REACT_APP_GUILLOTINE_URL=$ENONIC_API+'/master'
----

Replace `ENONIC_API_URL` with your real API URL:

* For Cloud: Add `/master` to the end of your Headless API URL
* For SDK: Use this: 

TIP: `/master` means we will access the master branch (published items)

== Start 

[source,Terminal]
----
npm start
----

This will launch the app in your default browser. 

TIP: Visit http://localhost:3000 directly if it does not launch automatically

== React router

Although beautiful, the app doesn't do much yet. Let's begin by adding a router and some custom styling:

. Delete the file `App.css` and add `App.sass instead:
+
.src/App.sass
[source,sass]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/App.sass[]
----
+
. Update your `App.tsx` file with the following code:
+
.src/App.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import React from 'react';

import './App.sass';

import {
  Route,
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
} from 'react-router-dom';


export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='*' element={<p>Hello router!</p>}/>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}
----
+
. Your browser should now display the text `Hello router!`.


== Next step

In the following chapter you'll create a proper React component - the <<list#,Person list>>.
