In this chapter you will create a React application with TypeScript support.

== Create React app

Start by running the following command:

[source,Terminal]
----
npx create-react-app react-enonic --template typescript
----

This will create a React app and place it in a folder called `react-enonic/`.

TIP: You can read more about the `create-react-app` tool on https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started[their website^]


== Install dependencies

With the basic project files in place, you must add some handy npm modules as well:

[source,Terminal]
----
cd react-demo

npm install --save react-router-dom sass @enonic/react-components @enonic/js-utils
----

== Configure

The React applications now needs to know the location of the Enonic API, as you we'll need it for fetching data later.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, containing a single line:

..env
[source,properties]
----
REACT_APP_GUILLOTINE_URL=<Query Playground URL>/master
----
Replace `<Query Playground URL>` with the URL you used to reach Query Playground when setting up Enonic.

NOTE: `/master` is added to the URL because we want to access the master branch (containing the published content)

Wonder why it is called Guillotine? Guillotine is simply the name for Enonic's headless GraphQL API.

== Start 

[source,Terminal]
----
npm start
----

This will launch the app in your default browser. 

TIP: Visit http://localhost:3000 directly if it does not launch automatically

== React router

Although beautiful, the app doesn't do much yet. 
Let's begin by adding a router and some custom styling:

. Add a file called `App.sass
+
We'll use this rather than the built-in App.css
+
.src/App.sass
[source,sass]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/App.sass[]
----
+
. Then *update `App.tsx` file* with the following code:
+
.src/App.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import React from 'react';

import './App.sass';

import {
  Route,
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
} from 'react-router-dom';


export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='*' element={<p>Hello router!</p>}/>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}
----
+
. Your browser should now display the text `Hello router!`.


== Next step

In the following chapter you'll create a proper React component - the <<list#,Person list>>.
