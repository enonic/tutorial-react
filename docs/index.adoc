= Tutorial React
:toc: right

In this tutorial we are going to create a `webapp` that fetches data from the `Enonic intro` app using `Guillotine` and client-side renders a one-page application using `React`.

The react application will use the `RichText` react component from `@enonic/react-components` in order to render Enonic TextComponents and HTMLArea-inputs that can contain images, links and macros.

We will use macros from the `Panel macros` app from Enonic Market and create a react component to render those macros.

This guide will show you how to:

* <<setup#,Set up>> a project
* Model: <<query#,Query>> for Person data (via Guillotine)
* Web application
* Static assets service
* Client-side "routing"
* View/Controller: Render PersonList and PersonComponents
