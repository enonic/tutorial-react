== Sample project

This tutorial is based on the `starter-tsup` project template.

To create a project for the tutorial, run the following command:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic project create com.example.tutorial.react -r starter-tsup -d react-tutorial
----

This will create an app and place it in a folder called `react-tutorial`.


== Peer apps

In order to fetch data from the `Enonic intro` app via `Guillotine`, we need to have both the `Enonic intro` app and the `Guillotine` app installed in our Enonic XP instance.

In addition make sure the `Panel macros` app is installed.
