== Create react project

Feel free to use your favourite tool to create react project, but for this tutorial we will use the following command to set up a project with typescript support:

[source,Terminal]
----
npx create-react-app react-demo --template typescript
----

TIP: you can read more about the `create-react-app` tool at https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started[their website]

This will create react app and place it in `react-demo` folder.

== Install dependencies

Now, let's add enonic libs, react-router-dom and sass to the project:

[source,Terminal]
----
cd react-demo

npm install --save react-router-dom sass @enonic/react-components @enonic/js-utils
----

With that done, you're ready to start the app:

[source,Terminal]
----
npm start
----

This will start the app and open it in your default browser.

== Update default app

Although beautiful, the default app doesn't do much.
Let's change content of the auto-generated `App.tsx` file to the following:

.src/App.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import React from 'react';

import './App.sass';

import {
  Route,
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
} from 'react-router-dom';


export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='*' element={<p>URL doesn't exist!</p>}/>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}
----

Notice we renamed the `App.css` file to `App.sass`.
Here is the content of the `App.sass` file:

.src/App.sass
[source,sass]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/static/styles/body.sass[]
----

Now, if you reload http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000], you should see the text `URL doesn't exist!` rendered on the page and that means you are ready for the next chapter!

== Next step

In the next chapter we'll create our first component -- <<personlist#,person list>>.
