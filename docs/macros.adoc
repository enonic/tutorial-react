= Macros

Rich Text also supports custom components - aka `Macros`.

== Background

In order to support more complex structure within Enonic's Rich Text editor, you can define macros.

TIP: Details on defining macros can be found in the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/macros[XP documentation^].


== Default macro handling

The sample content contains an example macro called `Factbox`, which has been added to the http://localhost:3000/p/lea-seydoux/a8b374a2-c532-45eb-9aa1-73d1c37cd681[Lea Seydoux^] bio.

By default, the RichText component will simply render a fallback placeholder:

To improve the situation, start by implementing a FactBox component.

== The FactBox component

Add the following files to your project:

.src/components/FactBox.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/components/FactBox.tsx[]
----

NOTE: The optional body of a macro is available as a React component called `children`.

.src/components/FactBox.module.css
[source,css]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/components/FactBox.module.css[]
----

Like other components, you may also declare a query for your Macro - but in this case we already have everything we need in the data returned from the original `bio` query.

== The Macro component

We now have a FactBox component, but we still need to map it to the Enonic macro definition. This can be solved by implementing a generic Macro component where you map specific macro descriptors to corresponding macro components.

.src/components/Macro.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/components/Macro.tsx[]
----

This component takes care of mapping each macro to its corresponding React component. In our case, `FactBox` component implements the macro called `com.enonic.app.intro:factbox` in Enonic.

It will throw an error otherwise, which will cause the RichText component's `ErrorBoundary` to render an `Error placeholder`.

== Use in RichText

Just like with `Link` and `Image` components, import `Macro` component and pass it to the `RichText` component:

.src/components/Person.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import {Macro} from './Macro';

// ..

<RichText
  // ...
  Macro={Macro}
  // ...
/>
----

If you did everything correctly, you should now see the `FactBox` macro rendered inside the biography on the http://localhost:3000/p/lea-seydoux/a8b374a2-c532-45eb-9aa1-73d1c37cd681[Lea Seydoux^] page:

== A final tip

Make an interface for RestProps so you can use it in other components as needed:

.src/components/RestProps.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
export interface RestProps {
    personID: string;
  }
----

You may pass additional parameters, such as `personID` to the RichText component by supplying a generic interface which declares them:

[source,TypeScript]
----
import { RestProps } from './RestProps';
  ...
<RichText<RestProps>
  ...
  personID="paramValue"
  ...
/>

interface RestProps {
  personID: string;
}
----

Import the interface and supply it to the Link.tsx, Image.tsx and Maxro.tsx components to make them aware of the new personID field:

[source,TypeScript]
----
import { RestProps } from './RestProps';

export const Link: LinkComponent<RestProps> = ({
----
