= Create a React app
:sourcedir: ../

In this chapter you will create a React application with TypeScript support.

== Create React app

With the sandbox running, open a new terminal tab/window and run the following command:

[source,Terminal]
----
npm create vite@latest react-enonic -- --template react-ts
----

This will create a React app and place it in a folder called `react-enonic/`.


== Install dependencies

With the basic project files in place, you must add some handy npm modules as well:

[source,Terminal]
----
cd react-enonic

npm install --save react-router-dom sass @enonic/react-components@5.0.1 @enonic/js-utils
----

== Configure

The React application now needs to know the location of the Enonic API, as we'll need it for fetching data later.

Open an IDE of your choice, and create an `.env` file in the root of your project, containing a single line:

..env
[source,properties]
----
VITE_GUILLOTINE_URL=http://localhost:8080/site/intro/master
----
which is the URL you used to reach Query Playground when setting up Enonic, with appended `/master`.

NOTE: `/master` is added to the URL because we want to access the master branch (published content).

Wonder why it is called Guillotine? Guillotine is simply the name for Enonic's headless https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine[GraphQL API].

== Start

Run this command from inside your project's folder:

[source,Terminal]
----
npm run dev -- --port 3000
----

This will launch the app on port 3000 in your default browser.

TIP: Visit http://localhost:3000[^] directly if it does not launch automatically

== React router

Although beautiful, the app doesn't do much yet and just shows the Vite+React splash screen.
Let's begin by adding a router and some custom styling:

. Add a file called `App.sass` to the `/src` folder. We'll use it instead of the built-in `App.css`.
+
.src/App.sass
[source,scss]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/App.sass[]
----
+
. Then *update `App.tsx` file* with the following code:
+
.src/App.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
import './App.sass';

import {
  Route,
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
} from 'react-router-dom';


export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='*' element={<p>Hello router!</p>}/>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}
----
+
. Your browser should now display the text `Hello router!`.


== Next step

In the following chapter you'll create a proper React component - the <<list#,Person list>>.
