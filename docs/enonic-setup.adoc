= Set up Enonic
:sourcedir: ../
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter, you will launch an Enonic instance that contains a dataset your React application is going to use.

You can choose between two options:

== Alternative 1 - Free Cloud instance

Follow these steps to get your Cloud service up and running:

. Sign up to Enonic's https://console.enonic.com[Free Plan account], and verify your e-mail
. Log in, and create your account
. Create a solution
+
Choose the template called `Headless demo`, then `Free plan`, give it a suitable name, and complete the setup.
+
. Once the solution has started, click the `Headless API` ingress link, this will launch Query Playground in your browser.

Continue in the <<#test_api, Test API section>>.

== Alternative 2 - Enonic SDK

Follow the instructions below to launch a local developer instance of Enonic:

. If you haven't installed Enonic CLI already, start by running the following command:
+
[source, Terminal]
----
npm install -g @enonic/cli
----
+
TIP: More installation methods along with CLI documentation can be found https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/stable/install[here]
+
. Create sandbox
+
Create a new sandbox (a developer instance of Enonic XP) by running the following command:
+
[source,Terminal]
----
enonic sandbox create react_tutorial -t intro -f
----
+
This will create a sandbox named `react-tutorial` using latest Enonic XP distribution and start it.
+
NOTE: The `-t intro` flag tells the CLI to provision a set of standard Enonic apps, including sample content you will use later in this tutorial.
+
You are now ready to test that the API is working:
+
. Open Query Playground by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/site/intro[http://localhost:8080/site/intro^] and continue below.

[#test_api]
== Test the API

If you followed the instructions above, you should now see the Query Playground in your browser.

*Paste and run the query below*:

[source,GraphQL]
----
query PersonListQuery {
    guillotine {
        queryDsl(
            first: 3
            query: {
                term: {
                    field: "type",
                    value: {
                        string: "com.enonic.app.intro:person"
                    }
                }
            }
            sort: {
                field: "modifiedTime",
                direction: DESC
            }
        ) {
            _id
            _name
            displayName
            type
        }
    }
}
----

This should produce a result looking something like this:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "_id": "a8b374a2-c532-45eb-9aa1-73d1c37cd681",
          "_name": "lea-seydoux",
          "displayName": "LÃ©a Seydoux",
          "type": "com.enonic.app.intro:person"
        },
        {
          "_id": "569d127d-b6bd-45d6-94b0-949ec6171336",
          "_name": "jeffrey-wright",
          "displayName": "Jeffrey Wright",
          "type": "com.enonic.app.intro:person"
        },
        {
          "_id": "f29ba9b7-a73a-4767-82db-9da4df952924",
          "_name": "daniel-craig",
          "displayName": "Daniel Craig",
          "type": "com.enonic.app.intro:person"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

== Next step

In the next chapter you will create a <<react-app#,React application>> which will fetch data from the Enonic sandbox we've just created, using GraphQL queries.
